        <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br></br>IOT is the emerging field in Internet technology era. It is basically the giant interconnection of objects/devices connected to Internet based on intelligence which is fusing the real and cyber worlds to share and receive
            the data. Anything that has the ability to connect to the internet is the part of IOT. It is all done by using sensors, software and actuators which send collected data to Internet where the processing is happening. In this 21st century innovation
            in IOT has changed the way of living and become an important part of our life Everything is the part of IOT that can be given an Internet protocol IP address i.e., it can be a vehicle with built-in sensors to give instructions to the driver
            to warn him when the tire pressure is low.

                    <br>There are vast applications of IOT which are divided into mainly five categories: <br>
                    </br><b style="font-family:algerian; ">CONSUMER APPLICATION: </b><br></br><b>SMART HOMES: </b><br></br>The first thing that comes in our mind when we heard about IOT application is Smart homes i.e., home automation concept which includes
                    security and camera system, switching on /off lights, controlling house temperature so it saves the cost by ensuring and limiting electricity usage and also make people aware of that. This is all done by using smart devices such as
                    iPhone and also can control by just wearing watches such as Apple watches. Th new advent in home automation is the functions and controlling in houses is done by using string of musical notes which is called as Allen Pan’s Home Automation
                    system. Homes can also be controlled by using your voice this really helps the people who have some disabilities like sight and physical disability can control their houses by just saying to smart device and can make use of this technology.
                    So, this technique provides assistance and makes life easier for many people. <a href="#line ">Go Back</a><br>

                    <p><br></br><b style="font-family:algerian; ">ORGANIZATIONAL APPLICATION</b><br></br><b>SMART HEALTHCARE</b><br></br>Another extensive application of the IoT is IoMT i.e., Internet of Medical things which turn this medical system into
                        interactive one. This digitalized healthcare system enables the people to check the available services the health resources. It keeps the record of the reports of patients and analyze the data for researching and monitoring the
                        disease. The distinctive feature of Iot is Wearable technology. Heartbeat, blood pressure, and glucose level these all can be monitored through wearable devices such as Fitbit wrist watches. The glucose level in the body can be
                        detected through a glucose sensor made of tiny electrode that is placed under the skin which passes the information through radio frequency to device. The improvement in it is that some hospitals also provide the facility of Smart
                        beds which record the date of admitting in hospital and schedule the date of leaving by checking the improvement in the patient so there is no need to check the patients manually by nurses. Like in these COVID period this is really
                        helpful and these smart health care devices also calculates the whole expenditure of treatment. The treatment of physical therapy is also done through these devices in which embedded systems are inserted and special sensors are
                        placed which connects with the home monitoring systems through artificial intelligence. Smart heart monitors are also very helpful in making cardiac patients’ medication and treatment. This IoMT technique makes the life easier
                        as patient, doctors and all the medical staff can get access to the patients’ record/data and analyzation becomes easier through it and prevention from diseases also become easier. Thus, IoMT is playing an important part in health
                        system.Another extensive application of the IoT is IoMT i.e., Internet of Medical things which turn this medical system into interactive one. This digitalized healthcare system enables the people to check the available services

                        <br></br><b>TRANSPORT SYSTEM</b><br></br>IoT is playing a fundamental role in transportation system. Inter and intra communication between vehicles and people can be done through these Iot devices. Many countries now a days using
                        smart city concept which is just because of IoT as engineers and government can check and make analysis that which factors are affecting a city like bad air and drinking water quality and pollution causing factors so that the government
                        can take steps for city planning which includes water, air, waste control and emergency systems in required cities. Smart traffic control, parking systems, product packaging and shipping i.e., logistics, electronic toll system
                        so to avoid traffic and many other systems can be managed precisely through these smart devices. In San Francisco, smart traffic system is used as they analyze through the devices that in which parts of the city is the traffic
                        blockage and for what purpose so they resolve it by installing the sensors at the parking places and these sensors exchange the data of vehicle parking occupancy to cloud as it gives the instructions to the drivers to move to other
                        place and through shortest route and also a person can park his car by just using the smart device and control its movement. In this way it minimizes the number of accidents and safety of vehicles is kept with the security systems
                        embedded in these devices. It also warns a person through the smart device whenever a person tries to unlock the car. <a href="#line">Go Back</a><br></br>

                    these smart devices and changes in building construction all the data is collected through these smart devices detected through sensors. So, it benefits the industry by saving money, saving energy and also saves the time and so the
                    work is done efficiently and precisely through this technology. <br></br><b>MILITARY APPLICATIONS</b></br><br>The technology of IoT is also finds its use in military zone as well. Sensors, robots, wearable devices, biometrics, and
                    other smart techniques are beneficial in wars. Through internet of military things all the data is collected and analysed and is recorded digitally. <br><a href="#line ">Go Back</a><br></br>

                <p><br></br><b style="font-family: Algerian; " style="text-align: center; ">Types of IoT in Wireless Networking</b><br></br><b>CELLULAR NETWORK</b><br>This is the large networking that uses mobile networks like smartphones to exchange the
                    information. Basically, these devices were made for power consuming devices like ovens, refrigerators, phones etc. but with the passage of time it spreads widely and become useful for large area networks in less cost and more efficiently.
                    <br></br><b>LOCAL AND PERSONAL AREA NETWORKS</b><br>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are the IoT connectivity solutions which are wireless LAN/PAN technologies and are costly. Wi-Fi uses more energy while Bluetooth uses less power but it is quite
                    slow in sending data while Wi-Fi is quick way to transfer data. <br></br><b>LOW POWER WIDE AREA NETWORK</b><br>For increasing the range than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth there is a solution i.e., Lora WAN long range area network devices are
                    used that has long life battery and less cost. So, it is useful in exchange of information packets over large area with less energy consumption. <br></br><b>MESH NETWORKS</b><br>In mesh networking all sensor nodes and data packets
                    coordinate in mesh networks as compared to star network in which all data packets are connected to a main hub. These are very short range and are costly as many sensors are required i.e., Zigbee is one of the mesh networks and it is
                    the fastest way of sending data by using shortest routes. <a href="#line ">Go Back</a><br></br>

                <p><br></br><b style="font-family:Algerian; ">DRAWBACKS</b><br>As there is a good side of the coin there are also certain limitations and pitfalls of IoT. <br></br><b>PRIVACY</b><br>Privacy is one of the major concerns of todays’ technology.
                    As data is collected through IoT devices so everyone wants his personal information is to be kept safe and sound and is not leaked publicly how much a person consumes on his food should not be shared on his work place. <br></br><b>SECURITY</b><br>Security
                    and safety are also one of the primary issues of IoT as if the software programs are hacked then the chances of misuse of personal information increases. So, the main barrier in adopting this technology is safety, security and privacy.
                    <br><br><b>COMPLEXITY</b><br>Due to large number of sensors, actuators, other hardware components smart devices this large mesh of network creates complexity so it becomes difficult and more complex to control such systems and also
                    some software errors may occur due to which a message is sent again and again and sometimes it may happen if some thing is consumed and it is required so a message is sent to both people and you get the thing double times so this will
                    result in waste of your money. <br><br><b>CONCLUSION</b><br>IoT is one of the best technology techniques so we cannot disregard its benefits as it is cost saving, time saving, work is done more efficiently and precisely than the traditional
                    way of doing the work in which work is done through only guesses and predictions. Everything has its own pros and cons and with the passage of time we can get control over these disadvantages and the day is not far from us when IoT
                    spread widely and use commonly in our homes and in each industry of world from houses to business it becomes part of each and every thing. <a href="#line ">Go Back</a><br></br>
